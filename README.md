# AB-testing_projects

Scenario: The app team developed a new algorithm for finding the most suitable profiles. To test the algorithm's performance, an AB test was conducted. All users were divided into two groups. Users in group 0 used the app with the old algorithm, while all users in group 1 used the app with the new algorithm for profile searching. The objective was to assess whether the new algorithm improved the quality of the service. To achieve this, relevant metrics were selected to measure the service quality, and statistical tests were performed to compare these metrics between the two groups.

Result: Based on the analysis, it is recommended to implement the new algorithm as it significantly improves the quality of the service, resulting in better user experiences and outcomes. ðŸš€

Students Research Project:

Scenario: I worked as an analyst in a food delivery app. The team implemented a smart product recommendation system in the app with the goal of helping users work more efficiently and find the necessary products better. To test the effectiveness of the recommendation system, an AB test was conducted. Users in group 1 were assigned to the new recommendation system, while users in group 0 used the old version of the app without product recommendations. The objective was to assess whether the new recommendation system brought benefits to the business and the app users. To achieve this, relevant metrics were selected to measure the service quality, and statistical tests were performed to compare these metrics between the two groups.

Result: After analyzing the data, it is recommended to introduce the new recommendation system as it brings significant benefits to the business and improves the user experience by assisting them in finding products more effectively. ðŸŽ‰

The projects demonstrate the **ability to use statistical tests, interpret the results, and generate new metrics for research**.
