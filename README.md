# AB-testing_projects

In the presented projects, **two AB tests** were conducted.

**1. Scenario:** The app team developed a new algorithm for finding the most suitable profiles. To test the algorithm's performance, an AB test was conducted. All users were divided into two groups. Users in group 0 used the app with the old algorithm, while all users in group 1 used the app with the new algorithm for profile searching. My task was to assess whether the new algorithm improved the quality of the service. **To do this, I needed to select metrics that measure the quality of the service and statistically compare these metrics between the two groups**.

**2. Scenario:** I work as an analyst in a food delivery app. The team implemented a smart product recommendation system in the app with the goal of helping users work more efficiently with the app and find the necessary products better. To test the effectiveness of the recommendation system, an AB test was conducted. Users in group 1 were assigned to the new recommendation system, while users in group 0 used the old version of the app without product recommendations. **My task was to assess whether the new recommendation system was able to bring benefits to the business and the app users. To do this, I needed to select metrics that measure the quality of the service and statistically compare these metrics between the two groups**.

The projects demonstrate the **ability to use statistical tests, interpret the results, and generate new metrics for research**.

**All datasets are attached in .csv format**
